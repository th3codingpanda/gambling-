<p>but you might ask yourself what is gambling? gambling is playing a game for a chance to earn money or most likely lose it.
    gambling can also mean taking a risky action in the hope of a desired result.gambling is mostly done in a casino but can also be done online (view page 2 for more info about online gambling) 
    .casinos usually have their own intrest in mind which is making more money for themselfs. which is why when you take a closer look at the games they dont seem as fair towards the player as towards the house.
    an example of this is the famous slotmachines.<br> <img src="Images/slotmachine.jpeg" alt="slot machine" width="250px"lenght="250px" style="border: 2px solid red;" > <br> Slotmachines fast machines and give adrenaline which can keep a person at them for a long time while they keep spending more and more money. one of the reasons for this is you might get 2 of the same numbers and think you were so close maybe ill get it next time.
    while in actuality you were as close as if you got 0 of the same numbers. Casinos ofcourse take advantage of this and earn money this way. the real issue lies within how the casinos are build. casinos are specialy made to keep people in them they do this by employing a vew strageties. Like the dimly lit lights which makes casinos look inviting,
    or the food and drinks you get for staying there.casinos also give illusions of BIG wins while in actuality the amount you can win is way less and way less likely. casinos even go as far as to get the best colors and even scents to make you stay longer.</p>
