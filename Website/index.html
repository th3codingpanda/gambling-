    <p>but you might ask yourself what is gambling? gambling is playing a game for a chance to earn money or most likely
        lose it.
        gambling can also mean taking a risky action in the hope of a desired result.gambling is mostly done in a casino
        but can also be done online (view page 2 for more info about online gambling)
        .casinos usually have their own intrest in mind which is making more money for themselfs. which is why when you
        take a closer look at the games they dont seem as fair towards the player as towards the house. the house is the
        casino and there is a saying that the house always wins.
        an example of this is the famous slotmachines.<br> <img src="Images/slotmachine.jpeg" alt="slot machine"
            width="250px" lenght="250px" style="border: 2px solid red;"> <br> Slotmachines are fast machines and give
        adrenaline which can keep a person at them for a long time while they keep spending more and more money. one of
        the reasons for this is you might get 2 of the same numbers and think you were so close maybe i'll get it next
        time.
        while in actuality you were as close as if you got 0 of the same numbers. Casinos ofcourse take advantage of
        this and earn money this way. but the real issue lies within how the casinos are build. casinos are specialy
        made to
        keep people in them like mouse traps they do this by employing a few strageties. Like the dimly lit lights which
        makes casinos
        look more inviting,
        or the food and drinks you get for staying there.casinos also give illusions of BIG wins while in actuality the
        amount you can win is way less and way less likely.casinos also have 0 clocks and 0 windows which means you
        don't know how long you've been in the casino. casinos even go as far as to get the best colors and even
        scents to make you stay longer.</p>
